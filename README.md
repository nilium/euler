This is a collection of source used to solve [Project Euler] problems.

Each branch corresponds to a different problem and language, so p1 is
problem 1, p2 is problem 2, and so on and so forth. Most problems will
be done in either Scheme or possibly Ruby, so you'll see p2-scheme,
maybe p3-ruby, maybe p4-clojure, who knows.

Unless noted otherwise, I'm using [Gambit-C] for Scheme.
